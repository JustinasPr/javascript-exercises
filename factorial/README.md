In mathematics `factorial` [is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) denoted as `n!`, given an integer `n`. The factorial function is a representation of `n!`, and this is what we will be creating.

Below is a start on the `index.js` file we will create in the `solutions` branch.



```js

let factorial = {

	// recursive
	recursive: function recursive(num) {

	},

	// iterative
	iterative: function iterative(num) {

	}

}

module.exports = factorial

```
