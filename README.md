# javascript-exercises
Coding exercises in JavaScript.



```bash

$ git clone https://github.com/markehost/javascript-exercises
$ cd javascript-exercises
$ npm install
$ cd factorial
$ npm test

```


This uses a TDD approach, look at the test.js file in each directory to see what needs to be implemented, write an index.js as the solution file.

Uses this project https://github.com/kolodny/exercises as a structural example.
