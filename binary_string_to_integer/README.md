Write a function that takes a binary string and converts it to an integer.  You can't use any built in Javascript methods of `Number` or `String`.  Build a function as if you had to natively implement this operation.

Below is a start on the `index.js` file we will create in the `solutions` branch.


```js

function binaryStringToInteger(str) {

	return str
}

module.exports = binaryStringToInteger

```
